  <h1>About Us</h1>
  <p>We are an international (broke) trio trying to pursue our goals in spreading the love for atonal, 
    non-sense, distorted and probably non-pleasant music. A special kind of Techno. Still, we kinda like it. 
    Check out our new track “Inferno”. The challenge for it? Not to dislike it :)</b>

<h1>The Band</h1>

<h3>Meet Cornelius</h3>
<p>Cornelius Eclipse AKA Frosted Flake is an veteran DJ and turn-tablist from Wapakoneta, Ohio.
    He got his nickname after a legendary DJ set at the Frosted Flakes 10 Year Anniversary Party 
    in Anaheim, CA that went semi-viral on Vine. Some say he has since fell off, but his crucial 
    part in DimFace’s success tells a different story. His hypersonic beats will itch your brain 
    like never before this summer.
</p>
    <h3>Meet DARK GOAT</h3>
    <p>Oier Aguirre, also known as The Dark Goat, started his music path when he was just 
        7 years old. He started as a classical percussionist and singer, but later on decided 
        to move to the dark side of music (Bach would have not like it) after realizing that 
        subwoofers were not part of the usual setup in an orchestra. His first approach to music 
        production and DJ-ing was in Minecraft, when he discovered that by putting note blocks 
        together he could do amazing covers such as “Electric Twinkle Twinkle”,  his first big hit. 
        After that, he decided to switch to Ableton and start his big journey by joining the “DIMFACE The Texno Trio”. </p>

    <h3>Meet Greg</h3>
      <p>Greg isnt actually in DIMFACE, at least not officially. Greg was too scared to 
        commit to the dark rituals needed to belong in the band, but we think hes chill 
        so he kinda just hangs out while we make music. he gets us dino nuggies and stuff.
        one day we were making our dark techno and greg pulled up to the studio (garage) 
        with a banjo and we recorded it and now we kinda just tell him to play on every track.
        we do not pay him.
